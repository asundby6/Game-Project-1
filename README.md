# Game-Project-1
Blackjack is a casino game that uses playing cards in which you and the dealer are dealt 2 random cards each. You are dealt two cards face up while the dealer has one of theirs face down. This is a game that's always alternating between the potential odds of winning / losing. Traditionally, this is a more secured bet for the casinos as they're multiple decks (4 or more) within the chute in order to reduce the odds of someone counting which. In regard to simplicity, and the desire to make this a more tactical approach, I instead have chosen to work with a single deck of cards (52 total) that refreshes after every hand instead of counting what's been drawn.
The dealer will continue to draw cards until the total sum of their hand is in between the numbers 17-21. Anything after that is a bust, and a win for you if you didn't bust as well. 
An addition to this version of blackjack is the opportunity for side bets that don't exist in traditional casinos. These bets include the "Bust It" bet, which activates whenever the dealer busts and you don't. The "Hot 3" bet which means that the values from the first three face up cards create a sum of 19, 20, or 21. "Any Pair" bet is only when the user's cards create a pair. The last bet is the "21+3" bet which is when the initial 3 cards are composed of a 3 card poker hand.
